#Iris

Home for the simple marine auto pilot project Iris. This project should be seen as a fun, exploring, educational project. Involving anything from prototyping of electronics and coding to control engineering. 

###Goals

The goal with this project is to get a boat follow a given heading, this is done with a microcontroller taking input from a GPS(heading, ground speed, clock and so on), a rotary encoder for letting the user set the desired heading, a potentiometer joystick is used for letting the user override the autopilot. All the data is displayed on a 5 to 7 inch TFT screen. At last the microcontroller controls a linear servo attached to the rudder via a motorcontroller.  
A PID regulator is to be implemented on the microcontroller for calculating the controller ouput to the servo.
In short this is a kickass project with many interesting parts.
